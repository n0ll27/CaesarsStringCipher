# CaesarsStringCipher
My own little take on Caesar's Cipher to demonstrate my ability to integrate various complex data structures into a single algorithm. I will add a special character and number edge case based on JS' built-in ASCII positional value API in the near future. This was really just a demo of what someone who hasn't taken DSA as of August 9th 2025. Don't worry, I will be taking DSA next semester in order to better improve my solutions by optimizing them. 

*Solution is currently O(n) time complexity.*
